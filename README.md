# Sound is connected to memory
Sound has an advantage remembering the environmental situation. But people donâ€™t record sound usually, while people take photos their daily life. 
I decided to use the behavior taking a photo to record sound. Taking panoramic photo takes approximately 5 seconds, and this length of the sound is going to make you recall the situation not only scenery.  A sound is related to feeling and emotion.
